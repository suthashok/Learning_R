#########################################Box Plot#########################################

BoxPlot is used to show the distribution of data along with it's range and median. It's effective in checking the outliers in the data.

> boxplot(data$column,col='blue')

The lower and upper edges of the box respectively show the values of the 25% and 75% quantiles

The "whiskers" of the box (the vertical lines extending above and below the box) relate to the range parameter of boxplot, which we let default to the value 1.5 used by R. The height of the box is the interquartile range, the difference between the 75th and 25th quantiles.

This shows us roughly how many, if any, data points are outliers, that is, beyond this range of values.

R command abline with the argument h will draw a horizontal line at given value, similarly argument  v will draw a veertical line. We can change the line width as well as it's color,

> abline (h=12,lwd=2,col='green')

####################################### Histogram #########################################

The histogram gives us a little more detailed information about our data, specifically the distribution of the counts, fall into each bucket of measurements.
> hist(data$column,col='green')

> rug(data$column)

R command rug gives us one-dimensional plot, with its grayscale representation, gives you a little more detailed information about how many data points are in each bucket and where they lie within the bucket.

break argument can be used  to split the data into the number of buckets.

> hist(data$column,col='green',break=100)


we can plot multiple histograms in one plot, though to do this we have to use more than one R command. First we have to set up the plot window with the R command par which specifies how we want to lay out the plots, say one above the other. We also use par to specify margins, a 4-long vector which indicates the number of lines for the bottom, left, top and right. Type the R command par(mfrow=c(2,1),mar=c(4,4,2,1)) now.


We can subset a dataframe based on a column value.
subset(data,column=='XYZ')

hist(subset(data,columnA=='XYZ')$columnB, col = "green")

######################################## Scatter Plots ##########################################

Scatter plots are two-dimensional plots which show the relationship between two variables, usually x and y.

with(data, plot(columnA, columnB))

if we want to color the datapoint based on a third clumn:

plot(pollution$latitude,ppm,col=pollution$region)
